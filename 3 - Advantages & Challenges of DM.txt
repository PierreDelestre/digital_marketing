x DM ADVANTAGES

! Digital marketing has certain advantages over traditional marketing because it:

    Reduces wasteful spending

    Adapts to new technologies

    Reaches target audiences with more precision

x Spending
% Advantage: Digital content is easier to create.

Challenge: Organizations engage in omnichannel marketing—the integration or synchronization of content on multiple 
channels—so customers can have a consistent brand experience. 
This increases the amount of content required, so even if it’s easier to create digital content, 
much more content needs to be created overall. 
Furthermore, it’s not just about the amount of content created, but its quality. 
Advertising is a crowded space. Content must be distinctive to positively impact customer awareness and change their behavior.

% Advantage: Digital marketing is more cost-effective than traditional marketing.

Challenge: If an organization is working towards an omnichannel presence, the cost for marketing on all channels adds up quickly. 
Getting support or buy-in for extra or additional budget to cover the cost can be difficult.


x Technology

% Advantage: Digital marketing adapts to new technologies.

Challenge: As a marketer, learning and keeping up with new technologies and tools is a constant requirement. 
Marketers must also stay up-to-date with and follow all user privacy and data sharing regulations worldwide. 
Omnichannel marketing also makes it more difficult to track where sales come from. 
Marketers must rely more heavily on analytics tools to help them do that.


x Target audiences

% Advantage: Digital marketing tools expand customer reach using specific audiences.

Challenge: The digital space is a crowded field that’s getting even more crowded. 
It’s harder for marketers to stand out with their advertising, even when they are targeting the right audiences.
